# wbc_sustained_obs
 
**Relevant code for Chandler et al. [in prep]. Western boundary current variability from sustained ocean observations.**
 
`XAA_ix21.m`, `XAA_px30.m`, and `XAA_px40.m` are the scripts to produce the velocity cross-sections for HR-XBT transects [IX21](http://www-hrx.ucsd.edu/ix15.html), [PX30](http://www-hrx.ucsd.edu/px31.html), and [PX40](http://www-hrx.ucsd.edu/px40.html).
 
`ix21_velocity.nc`, `px30_velocity.nc`, and `px40_velocity.nc` are the velocity cross-section data files output from the above scripts. These will also be made available on the Scripps Institution of Oceanography eScholarship site.

`Fig1.m`, `Fig1_panels.m`, `Fig2.m`, `Fig3.m`, `Fig4.m`, `Fig5.m` are the scripts used to produce the respective figures in the submitted manuscript.

The `additional_functions` folder includes my functions I have used in the above scripts. Other functions I have used include those from [TEOS-10](http://www.teos-10.org/) and [MATLAB File Exchange](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/) - please contact me for specifics.
